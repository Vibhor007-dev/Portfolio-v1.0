            <h1>TREX GAME</h1>
            <p> The Trex Game is a game where we create one trex jumping over obstacles and trying to dodge them. I got
                the idea of the trex game from when my interent went off and the game used to pop up in my web browser!
                It took 8 classes to make this game with a lot of effort but in the end I learnt a lot and it was a lot
                of fun! I also converted my trex game into a mobile game via an app known as Thunkable.</p>

            <h1>CAR RACING GAME</h1>
            <p> The Car Racing Game is a game where I created a car racing game thriugh learning database and firebase.
                The concepts that I learnt: I made them alive by coding that game. Its basically a game of 4 car racers
                who compete other players to reach the finish line of the game. If you want to play the game with your
                friends, open the tab 4 times</p>

            <h1>TOWER SIEGE GAME PARTS 1 AND 2</h1>
            <p>The Tower Siege Game was a game about throwing blocks at a tower by making a constraint and to launch it
                through a slingshot. These games were pretty cool. The Part 2 one was that the constraint will come back
                to its original position after pressing space.</p>
