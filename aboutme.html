<p>Hello! I am Vibhor Singh, a student studying in Grade 9. My hobbies are playing video games, coding games and studying mesmerising novels about fiction and fantasy! I have interest in subjects like Economics, Law and Geography. Currently I am learning coding through WhiteHatJr and other than that I am learning TypeScript on my own. I love creating games and as you see in my projects you will notice all the projects I have created!</p>
